     Check data of new sensors and why can't we find a 0 quality signal every time
     Verify why pulse algo fails on certain data on agco (find solution for fail on main bang end)
     Check agco data manually to check if there is a better way to process the raw data when the peak is larger (and when the wavefront is at the end of a large peak)
     Improve next fill prediction algo to work on other type of silos (try package such as statsforecast), (add approach to treat silos in pairing like in avinor)
