(!!) Check agco data manually to check if there is a better way to process the raw data when the peak is larger (and when the wavefront is at the end of a large peak)
     Improve next fill prediction algo to work on other type of silos (try package such as statsforecast), (add approach to treat silos in pairing like in avinor)
 (!) Add error bars to wavefront (maybe based on width of signal, or with different threshold i.e. 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75)
 (!) Try elastic search
(!!) Try to improve wavefront on troubled region (maybe try lower threshold, postprocess with max consumption speed)
