(C) Verify/fix algo to work on low resolution raw data
(C) Continue smoothing algos exploration: refine spike detection, make all filters more easily chainable, explore more options: gregstanleyandassociates.com/whitepapers/FaultDiagnosis/filtering
(B) Start project on disease detection using loadcell data on Avinor: detect a decrease in food consumption of 30% or more for 2 days. Use both silos A and B conjunctly to determine rate of consumption and start/end of chicken cycles
Refine/rethink the algo to change acquisition parameters of the device (gain, current, pulse)
